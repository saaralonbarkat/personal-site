I am an academic researcher of Public Administration and Public Policy. 

My main research interest is in the interrelations between modern government bureaucratic organizations and their external audiences, and their implications for democracy.

I am currently working as a postdoctoral researcher of Public Administration at the Institute of Public Administration at Leiden University. I am conducting my research within the ERC-funded EURICA project (Reputation matters in the regulatory state: [euricaerc.eu](http://euricaerc.eu/)), led by Prof. Madalina Busuioc. 

I received my Ph.D. in Public Administration from the Hebrew University of Jerusalem in 2019. In my doctoral research, I explored how symbolic aspects in government communications with citizens influence, and manipulate, the attitudes of citizens about government organizations. In additional research projects, I studied government organizations' responses to public pressures, and specifically to large-scale social protest.

I am a methodological pluralist. I specialize in behavioral experiments, yet in my previous research, I employed a variety of additional empirical approaches, including cross-sectional time-series analyses, quantitative case studies, and quantitative and qualitative analyses of interviews. I enjoy working with data in R.
