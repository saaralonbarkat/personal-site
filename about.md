I am a postdoctoral researcher of Public Administration at the Institute of Public Administration at Leiden University. I received my Ph.D. in Public Administration from the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. My main academic research interest is in the interrelations between modern government bureaucratic organizations and their external audiences, and their implications for democracy. 

My doctoral research,  at the Department of Political Science at the Hebrew University, focused on bureaucracies’ communication with citizens’, and specifically the symbolic aspects of these communications, which are most prominent in the use of branding and marketing. I explored, via behavioral experiments, the influence of symbolic aspects in government public communication on citizens’ attitudes about government organizations. In additional research projects, I studied government organizations’ responses to public pressures.

I am a methodological pluralist. In my research, I employ a variety of empirical and methodological approaches, including behavioral experiments, cross-sectional time-series analyses, quantitative case studies, and quantitative and qualitative analyses of interviews. I enjoy working with data in R.

In addition to my academic background, I also have practical experience at the civil service. Before starting my graduate program, I worked in the Israeli Ministry of Justice, at the Attorney General's office, and also at the Prime Minister's Office, at the Department of Governance and Policy Planning.
