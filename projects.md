###The effects of symbols and information in government communication on citizens trust in policy: Evidence from a survey experiment  

####Abstract
> Effective public communications have been proposed as a remedy for citizensג€™ distrust in government. The studies that explored the effectiveness of government communications have focused mainly on the extent to which they provide substantive information about bureaucraciesג€™ performance and policies. Recently, a few studies pointed to the effect of symbolic elements, entangled in these communications (e.g. logos, images and celebrities). Still, we lack theoretical understanding of the different mechanisms underlying citizensג€™ responses to information and symbolic elements, and accordingly - the interaction between them. Building on the Elaboration Likelihood Model (ELM) from social psychology, I hypothesize that symbolic elements have a greater effect on citizensג€™ trust the less citizens perceive the issue as personally relevant. Also, I hypothesize that symbolic elements are likely to lead citizens to dedicate less attention to the substantive information in the communication, and accordingly, to increase their trust in in logically-unpersuasive policy plans. I put these hypotheses to test through a survey experiment, where I examine Israeli citizensג€™ trust in the Environment Protection Ministryג€™s policies for reducing the air pollution in a specific area (the Haifa-Bay) and reducing domestic waste. The policies are presented to subjects under different conditions of substantive information (logically persuasive vs. unpersuasive policies) and symbolic elements (logo, color, and celebrities endorsers). I operationalize personal relevance both experimentally, and by comparing between citizens from the polluted Haifa-Bay area and others. The results do not support the hypothesis that personal relevance attenuates the effect of symbols. Rather, they suggest that symbolic elements increase citizensג€™ trust in ill-perceived policies, by distracting them from scrutinizing their content.

###Bureaucracies' Shaping of Citizens' Attitudes: Functional, Informational, Procedural-Fairness and Symbolic Effect  

####Abstract
> How do bureaucracies influence the formation of citizens' attitudes towards them, including citizens' trust, satisfaction, legitimacy, and performance evaluation? Whereas current public administration literature have addressed this question with regard to distinct contexts and aspects, in this paper I establish a general theoretical framework. Based on the accumulated current research I identify three analytically-distinct mechanisms through which bureaucracies may influence citizens' attitudes: the delivery of tangible outcomes (functional mechanism), the provision of performance information (informational mechanism) and the fairness and ethicality of their decision-making processes (procedural-fairness mechanism). In addition, I theorize that over and above these three mechanisms, bureaucracies may shape citizens' attitudes via symbolic communication, most prominently through branding, marketing, publicity and the like (symbolic mechanism). Symbolic communication can shape citizens' attitudes inasmuch as it conveys meanings and associations, and evokes emotional responses. I conceptualize these four effects, and propose specific moderators for the symbolic mechanism. I conclude by discussing the theoretical, methodological and normative implications of the suggested theoretical framework, and proposing a research agenda.

* First drafts of the paper were presented on April 2015 at the MPSA Conference, and on December 2015 at the [Rabin Graduate Conference in Jerusalem](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/287196202_Bureaucracies%27_Shaping_of_Citizens%27_Attitudes_Functional_Informational_Procedural-Fairness_and_Symbolic_Mechanisms).
