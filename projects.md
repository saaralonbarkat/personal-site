###The Effects of Substantive Information and Symbols on Citizens' Attitudes, and Their Moderation by Personal Relevance  

####ABSTRACT
> Effective public communications have been proposed as a remedy for citizens' distrust in government. The studies that explored the effectiveness of government communications have focused mainly on the extent to which they provide substantive information about bureaucracies' actions. However, these studies have largely overlooked the effect of symbolic elements, entangled in these communications (e.g. logos, images and celebrities). This study aims to enhance our understanding of the different psychological effects of substantive information and symbolic elements, and the relations between them. Building on the Elaboration Likelihood Model (ELM) from social psychology, I theorize that citizens will be more susceptible to substantive information (as opposed to symbols) when they perceive the policy issue in the communication as having personal relevance for themselves, which enhances their motivation to invest in elaborate processing. To test this expectation, I design two survey experiments, focusing on the responses of Israeli citizens to the Environmental-Protection Ministry's communication of its policy plan in relation to the air pollution in the Haifa Bay area. The communication will be displayed to subjects under varying conditions of substantive information and symbolic elements, to manipulate these factors. To account for personal relevance, I compare between citizens from the polluted Haifa Bay area and others. The results of Experiment 1 do not support the hypotheses. However, it tentatively suggests that symbolic elements reduce the effect of substantive information, and thus enhance citizens' trust in ill-conceived government policies. These findings will be replicated in experiment 2.

###Bureaucracies' Shaping of Citizens' Attitudes: Functional, Informational, Procedural-Fairness and Symbolic Effect  

####ABSTRACT
> How do bureaucracies influence the formation of citizens' attitudes towards them, including citizens' trust, satisfaction, legitimacy, and performance evaluation? Whereas current public administration literature have addressed this question with regard to distinct contexts and aspects, in this paper I establish a general theoretical framework. Based on the accumulated current research I identify three analytically-distinct mechanisms through which bureaucracies may influence citizens' attitudes: the delivery of tangible outcomes (functional mechanism), the provision of performance information (informational mechanism) and the fairness and ethicality of their decision-making processes (procedural-fairness mechanism). In addition, I theorize that over and above these three mechanisms, bureaucracies may shape citizens' attitudes via symbolic communication, most prominently through branding, marketing, publicity and the like (symbolic mechanism). Symbolic communication can shape citizens' attitudes inasmuch as it conveys meanings and associations, and evokes emotional responses. I conceptualize these four effects, and propose specific moderators for the symbolic mechanism. I conclude by discussing the theoretical, methodological and normative implications of the suggested theoretical framework, and proposing a research agenda.
