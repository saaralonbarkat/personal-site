I am a Ph.D. candidate in public administration at the Hebrew University's Political Science Department. I am also a fellow of [the Azrieli fellows program](http://fellows.azrielifoundation.org/). 

I am interested in the relations between bureaucratic organizations and citizens. My doctoral research project focuses on bureaucracies' communication with citizens', and specifically the symbolic aspects of these communications, which are prominent in the use of branding and marketing tools (e.g. the use of logos, images, celebrity endorsements and the like). I explore how symbolic aspects in government public communication shape citizens' attitudes about government. 

I am a methodological pluralist. In my research, I employ a variety of empirical and methodological approaches, including behavioral experiments, cross-sectional time-series analyses, quantitative case studies, and quantitative and qualitative analyses of interviews. I enjoy working with data in R.

In addition to my academic background, I also have practical experience at the civil service. Before starting my graduate program, I worked in the Israeli Ministry of Justice, at the Attorney General's office, and also at the Prime Minister's Office, at the Department of Governance and Policy Planning.

I volunteer at the Public Knowledge Workshop ("Hasadna"), an Israeli non-profit organization, which aims at making public information accessible to citizens via open-sourced internet projects, thereby promoting citizens' meaningful political participation. Within the "Hasadna", I am involved in the ["budget key project"](www.obudget.org), which seeks to make information on public budgeting, including government spending, accessible to the public.
