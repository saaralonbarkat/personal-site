I am an academic researcher of Public Administration. My main research interest is in the interrelations between modern government bureaucratic organizations and their external audiences, and their implications for democracy.

I am currently working as a postdoctoral researcher of Public Administration at the Institute of Public Administration at Leiden University. I am conducting my research within the ERC-funded EURICA project (Reputation matters in the regulatory state: [euricaerc.eu](http://euricaerc.eu/)), led by Prof. Madalina Busuioc. 

I received my Ph.D. in Public Administration from the Hebrew University of Jerusalem in 2019. My doctoral research,  at the Department of Political Science at the Hebrew University, focused on bureaucracies’ communication with citizens’, and specifically the symbolic aspects of these communications, which are most prominent in the use of branding and marketing. I explored, via behavioral experiments, the influence of symbolic aspects in government public communication on citizens’ attitudes about government organizations. In additional research projects, I studied government organizations’ responses to public pressures.

I am a methodological pluralist. I specialize in behavioral experiments, yet in my previous research, I employed a variety of additional empirical approaches, including cross-sectional time-series analyses, quantitative case studies, and quantitative and qualitative analyses of interviews. I enjoy working with data in R.
